# IM STIN: Image Stitching and Inpainting

This project uses a deep image stitching model that stitches two images based on their features and homographic techniques. Later, it uses an impainting model to 
inpaint the gaps created as a result of warping.

## Deep Stitching Model UDIS

We use a model of one of the components that stitches the images. The model is available at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GBwB0y3tUUsOYHErSqxDxoC_Om3BJUEt/view?usp=sharing"> Google Drive </a>. For more details, please look at
